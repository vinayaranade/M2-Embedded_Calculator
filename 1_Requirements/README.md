# Requirements

In Everyday life security places a major role. This project aims at creating a security access system which grants access after entering a password. It uses a keypad to enter a password and when the entered password matches the system set password it grants access to the user  . It will give three attempts to enter the password when it is entered incorrectly at the first time. Some features like adding new users and changing old password are configure by the keypad. LCD module is used to display messages to the user. This system will be able to replace traditional lock systems at a lower cost and provide better and  security.

# Research/State of Art 

The fundamental goal of this project is to reclaim safety in everyday settings such as homes and public spaces. In this project, all of the data is kept in the system when the microcontroller will be programmed with the correct words you can provide steering to the servo engine, you can open the door unlock. Instead of the traditional lock system most of the systems are automated in order to face new challenges and present day requirements to achieve good results. Automated systems have less manual operations, so that the flexibility, reliabilities are high and accurate. Hence  field prefers automated control systems.


# SWOT Analysis 

### Strengths:
 •	Provides high level and efficient security system .
 
 •	It is low in cost and has easy imstallation.
 
 •	It is easy to use for consumers.
 
 •	It is easy to implement and give safety in any place.
 
 ###  Weakness:
  • It does not provide an option to reset a password in case forgotten .
  
  • In case wrong password is entered the system will get locked .
  
  • It uses only password for security which can be increased with the use of bometric system or iris scanning system etc.
  
### Opportunities:
 • Secure  and digital security system. 
 
 • Affordable locking system to keep valuable things safe.
 
 ### Threats:
 • In case of power failure it will get locked and cannot be opened .
 
 • It involves only a digital password system and no other auxillary system for incresed security and in case of failure of password system.
 
 • It has only one password setup and no option for multiple users .

#### What  :

The main objective of this project is to style a secure door lockup system. to make this project  to perform sure task like, planning the facility provide for
the whole electronic equipment choice of Microcontroller, Key pad, DC motor and LCD .

#### Where  :
  It can  be implemented in any places like our Houses, Institutions, Banks and any Public Places. 
 
#### Who   : 
 The project also exhibits low cost home security system wh ich is widely e mployed in ou r daily  life. This  system  is  designed  to  prevent  the  opening  of  the  door  by  unauthorized  persons.  The structure  of  home security system .As the cost of the system is low it can be used by everyone in their everyday life
 
#### When :

In this digitally dependent world, the security is most concern for every one . As we all are facing the fear of robbery, people cannot keep their valuable things
safely even at their own houses, banks or in any other places. They are always in fear of losing their valuable things. Old traditional locking system is not that safe as
password based door locking system hence the need for such automated digital locking systems has developed .

#### How:
This design of electronic based security system is fully microcontroller based system. The operation involves entering of a paascode to the system with the use of keypad which will intiate display and opening of the lock .It is more efficent security system as compared to the conventional key system .

# High level Requirements 
| ID | Description  |Status|
| ------ | ------ |------|
| HLR  1 | System should accept entered password. | Implemented|
| HLR  2 | It should display the entered password  |Implemented |
| HLR  3 | It should check if entered password is correct and grant access. | Implemented |

# Low level Requirements 
| ID | Description  | Status |
| ------ | ------ | ------|
| LLR  1 | In case wrong password entered system should display error messsage  | Implemented |
| LLR  2 | It should allow to enter password 3 times in case oof failed attempt | Implemented |
